- Print to output file (Time, site, phrase, count) 
  	- this should probably be a member function
- implement the timing part (probably in main)
- implement threading
  - there are fetch and parse threads {both get woken by some condition variable}
  	- fetch
  		- gets url or website from queue and pops it
  		- uses libcurl to get contents
  		- saves contents to different queue
  	{remembering mutex and condition variables because it's a producer/ consumer problem}
  	- parse
  		- checks the search phrase 
  		- puts results somewhere
  		- what are the different threads doing? reading different files? different parts of the same files?
  			- do we figure out where it leaves off like the pixel problem?
